In 2017, I was invited to the Center of Exellence in Education's Research Science Institute (RSI), a prestigious summer research program for incoming high school seniors that held at MIT.
At RSI, I had the privilege of interning at Aurora Flight Sciences under the mentorship of Dr. Jaewoo Choi and Franklin Wu. Aurora is a leader in the development of advanced unmanned systems and aerospace vehicles. My research over the summer involved developing a low-cost aircraft collision avoidance system, with the goal to making air-travel safer. The research paper (link above) was written during the rigorous 6 weeks at RSI.
# Abstract

In recent years, congestion in the global airspace has been increasing at an exponential rate, increasing the probabilities of an air collision. Currently, tranponder based collision avoidance systems fail when other aircraft do not have compatible transponders systems installed. To reduce reliance on a tranponder based collision avoidance system, a low cost radar-based collision avoidance system for aircraft was developed. The tracking system was developed using memory efficient cluster identification algorithms to identify nearby aircraft, state estimation equations to develop track associations to differentiate between multiple nearby moving aircraft, and Extended Kalman Filters for aircraft position and velocity estimation refinements. During the testing phase, aircrafts were accurately tracked in the local airspace, demonstrating the low-cost radar system's feasibility. Modern Collision Avoidance Systems for aircraft cost about $20 million, while the developed Sense and Avoid radar system costs only $20,000. Thus, we demonstrate that the cost of aircraft collision avoidance systems can potentially be reduced by a factor of 1000.

# Summary

The Air Traffic Control (ATC) is tasked with guiding an array of airplanes, each travelling to different destinations, through a controlled airspace. The ATC strives to control the aircraft in an efficient manner to avoid delays, while ensuring passenger safety. Due to increasing air traffic congestion, the probability of collisions has significantly increased. Thus, it is essential that all aircraft, whether they are large comercial aircraft or small private aircraft, are equipped with appropriate Collision Avoidance Systems. In this paper, a low cost radar-based collision avoidance system is developed and tested with the hope of constructing a collision avoidance system that will eventually be installed in aircraft in the near-future.
