<div id="Introduction"><h3>The Team</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>We are the 'Trash Terminators 2.0'</li>
    <li>Our team: Rohan Deshpande, Vincent Chen, Elizabeth Farmer, Quentin Sieredzki, and Graeme Zimmermann</li>
    <li>School: Guy B Phillips Middle School, Chapel Hill, NC</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div id="Problem">
  <h3>The Problem</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Our Chapel Hill landfill closed on July 1st 2013 and our trash is now transported more than 100 miles away to a new location </li>
    <ul>
      <li>This is adding cost in transportation and in dumping fees</li>
      <li>creates more pollution</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Using a carbon footprint calculator, we found that for every ton of trash which our city will generate and ship to the new landfill, we will be releasing 57 pounds CO2 /ton of trash and spending $55/ton of trash. </li>
    <li>Cafeteria trash audits conducted at other Chapel Hill Carrboro City Schools (CHCCS) showed that between 50-60% of trash is compostable.</li>
    <li>35% our city's trash is compostable based on Orange County Solid Waste Management data</li>
    <li>By starting composting at all CHCCS schools and in our local community we will significantly:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduce greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide</li>
      <li>Reduce emission of methane gas which is caused by food in landfill</li>
      <li>Reduce the amount of money our county pays shipping the trash 100 miles away</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</div>
