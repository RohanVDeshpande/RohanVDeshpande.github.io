<h1 class="XPTitle">Volunteering at the Agastya Foundation</h1>

<p>I realized during a visit to India that many children around the world are unable to access education for economic reasons. Last year, I found out that the Agastya International Foundation in India has the goal to teach hands-on science to underprivileged rural children in India, and received funding from companies like Google. The NGO used some of the funds to buy Arduino and Lego Robotics kits; however, they did not have volunteers who could teach these tools to the students. I loved Agastya’s mission and decided to travel to India to volunteer at the foundation. Over my stay at Agastya, I developed technology related coursework for teaching the basics of Arduino, circuit design, and programming. I also had the opportunity to teach the material that I had developed to hundreds of students. I taught the students how to create an LED that blinks ON and OFF at 1 second intervals using the Arduino Microcontroller. When the students uploaded the code to the Arduino and the program worked correctly, the students beamed with excitement. I was inspired by the “thirst to lean” in rural students in India, and realized that there are many inquisitive and curious children who are unable to access education due to economic reasons. I realized that I could leverage the internet to reach thousands of rural children in developing countries. I am currently working on developing Youtube videos with the vision of creating a “Khan Academy” for Engineering/Technology and hands-on science, which I call “Rohan Teaches”.  The Rohan Teaches Youtube channel will allow me to remotely teach many more students and, thus, make a much greater impact.</p>
