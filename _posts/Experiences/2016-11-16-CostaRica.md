<h1 class="XPTitle">My adventure trip to Costa Rica</h1>
<div id="CostaRica">
<p>Our Trash Terminator team won first place in the national Siemens "We Can Change The World" sustainability Challenge. Along with other prizes, one of the prizes was a Discovery adventure trip to Costa Rica which will be the first carbon neutral country by 2021. I was looking forward to this five day educational trip which was in mid July.</p>
<p>Costa Rica borders Panama (to it's south), Nicaragua (to its north), Caribbean(to its east), and Pacific(to its west). Costa Rica's terrain consists of mountains, plains, and tropical forest. Due to Costa Rica's tropical climate it has only dry and wet seasons. This country is home to approximately 500,000 species of plants and animals 300,000 of them are insects. Costa Rica got its name when the Spanish conquistadors came on an expedition to the country. The island off the coast of Costa Rica where they first landed was full of natives that were wearing gold necklaces. Thats how the country got its name: Costa Rica or rich coast.</p>
<p>Our flight from Raleigh to San Jose, Costa Rica was fun. I was feeling a little nervous since I had never done international travel without my family! But Discovery education had planned the trip very well. Once we got out of the airport we were received by our tour guide who stayed with us for next 5 days. The first lesson we learnt was not to flush toilet paper in the toilet because of the tropical climate.</p>

<p>On the first day we started our day very early at 5:30 am since we had a 4 hour bus drive ahead of us to Veragua research center. On the way we passed through a mountain range and got to see a few waterfalls. We stopped at a fruit stand where we tried fruits like Mormon chino, which is hairy on the outside but is exactly like leeche on the inside. The fruit Mormon chino was originally grown in China. Another fruit we got to taste was Mangosteen which is shaped and colored like an avocado from the outside but has lobes of fruit like orange on the inside. We also tried a fruit called water apple which has the shape of a pear but is pink. After eating these juicy fruits we continued to Veragua. Our tour guide educated us about the banana farms that stretched endlessly in both directions. </p>

<p>After a few hours we arrived at Veragua research center just in time for lunch. The researchers at Veragua gave us a presentation where we learnt how they dig artificial ponds for endangered species so they can use it as breeding grounds. They told us how each researcher has their own specialty. Some look after the butterfly garden while others look for rare insects. They even have a snake charmer who finds and cages poisonous snakes that are found at the research center. Later we went on an aerial tram to a trail where we saw the artificial ponds and how they were created. While we walked on the trail we spotted a red poisonous frog which is the most poisonous frog at Veragua. The effects of the poison can be felt if you hold the frog for 10 minutes. Despite this fact the frog expert quickly caught the frog and showed it to us. He thankfully didn't feel the poison since he catches frogs and holds them every day. </p>

<p class="right">We went to a snake exhibit which had local snakes from Veragua. When one of the students took a picture, all the snakes jumped towards the photographer only to be stopped by the glass. This reminded us how dangerous the snakes at Veragua are. While walking to the next exhibit, somebody screamed the word spider (I am scarred of spiders:(! We all turned and looked and sure enough there was a big spider.  We also noticed that there was a wasp next to it. We watched as the wasp paralyzed the spider, injected larva into the spider(while the spider was alive), flew the spider into a hole(the spider is still alive), and waited for the wasp larva to hatch inside the still alive spider. The tour guide told us that this was a natural process and the  purpose behind this act was that wasp larva has food as soon as it hatches. The spider finally dies when the larva has finished eating it from the inside. What a scary experience!! </p>

<p class="right">We quickly moved on to the butterfly exhibit trying to get this disturbing information out of our minds. In the butterfly exhibit we saw hundreds of exotic and colorful butterflies in glass cases. Some of the butterflies I saw at Veragua were similar to the ones that I saw at the Purdue bug bowl(which had a collection of butterflies from all over the world). </p>

<p class="normal">Once we arrived back at the research center we were issued cabins for the night. We got ready for the night hike which was right after dinner. We had a quick dinner and started our night hike.    During the night hike the 2nd place winning team didn't come since they were still grossed out about the wasp and spider experience. We got to see a species of ant called the bullet ants. The pain from the bite of a bullet ant is equivalent to the pain of getting shot by a bullet. We also got to see some nocturnal birds and owls. One of them sounds like a witch screaming! This species haunted us all night as we tried to get some sleep in our old rustic cabin with lots of holes and gaps between each plank where insects could easily come in.</p>

<p class="up">On the 2nd day we woke up early again so that we can arrive at the Caribbean shore on time. Our tour guide went to a booth where we were originally going to do snorkeling but due to harsh weather(extremely rough water and potential rain) we weren't able to go into the water.</p>
<p class="up">We decided to continue with our schedule and go on a 4.5 mile hike. Half of the hike was in the forest and half was along the beach.  On the way back we got to see 2 howler monkeys fighting. The fight was between the oldest male child and the alpha male. Every time a tourist came to see what was going on, the alpha male started breaking dead branches and throwing them at the ground trying to show how strong he was.Soon the young male got scared and had to leave the pack. This was an exciting experience since it was in the wild. I was also thankful that I was with experienced chaperons. During our hike, we saw a type of plant that closed its leaves when you touch it. After the hike we went to a nearby restaurant for lunch.  And guess what we had for lunch, once again rice and beans! Later we drove north west to Earth university. The drive to Earth was 2 hours. On the trip we saw more banana farms. </p>

<p class="left">At Earth University we explored the campus and spent some time in the library where all the books were in Spanish. After dinner we all went to the pool to relax. We saw bats swooping down on the surface of the pool and catching a few insects in the pool. It was a little scary because the bats almost flew into us before turning away but it was an interesting experience.</p>
<p class="left">The next morning we had a new tour guide at Earth who gave us a bus tour of the university. Our first stop was a farm where they showed us how they used animal waste as bio-fuel to generate electricity. After seeing the dairy and animal farm we saw the banana farm. We learnt that most of the bananaâ€™s found at whole foods were grown at earth university. Next we went to the garden where we learnt how to make cheap compost. They make their compost out of charcoal, sand, rice husk, and coconut fiber which is in abundance in Costa Rica. We also learnt how they reuse bottles, tires, and wheels as edging for the garden. </p>

<p class="right">Then we saw their methods of growing crop. One of the methods can be used for Urban farming. At Earth this method is called vertical farming. It involves having a bag full of dirt that has been hung vertically. On the circumference are the crop that are being planted. This allow the farmers at Earth university to fit more crops in a small amount of space. </p>
<p class="right">The second method of farming is called sausage farming which also involves a big bag with dirt in it. The difference is that the bags are laid on a wooden platform horizontally. the platform is shaped in a triangular form which allows at 7 bags to sit side by side one elevated a little higher than the other. </p>
<p class="right">After lunch we got to see the recycling warehouse. This is where they sell all the plastics that are recycled. In the warehouse they separated all the plastics into different piles(ABS, polystyrene,etc.). Then the buyer cuts plastic into small pellets that are used for plastic injection molding. We also learned how to reuse tetra packs and make wallets out of them. At Earth, they are growing forest on landfill which was very interesting!</p>

<p class="up3">On the last night in San Jose, we did souvenir shopping and later got to sleep in a nice bed  without worrying about bugs, snakes, and scary birds.</p>
<p class="up3">Thank you Siemens for conducting this amazing competition that taught me a great deal about sustainability. I also thank Discovery for arranging a very nice adventure trip to Costa Rica  where we learnt new methods of sustainability and were able to learn a lot from the researchers. I am excited to implement new sustainability ideas at my school.</p>
