I started playing the upright bass when I was in 4th grade. I have played Bass in school Orchestra from 4th to 8th grade and at Duke String School Orchestra since 6th grade. I currently play in Youth Symphony Orchestra at DUSS. I also have participated in UNC Summer Jazz camp in 2014 and 2015, and have participated in UNC Greensboro music camp in summer 2013. I was selected to play Bass at the Junior Eastern Regional Orchestra organized by NC Music Educators Association in 7th and 8th grades.
