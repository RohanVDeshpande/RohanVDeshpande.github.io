<div id="C1"><h2>Circuit Design</h2><p>For my 6th birthday my mom, an electrical engineer, bought me a Snap Circuits kit sparking my everlasting interest in electronics. When our family DVD player reached the end of its life, my parents allowed me to dismantle it. Seven years later I still have the opened DVD player, which I currently use to salvage parts. In 2012, when I was in 6th grade, I signed up for the Shock Value Circuit Design event in Science Olympiad. Throughout the next two years I was taught by Duke University Professor Dr.Wu where I learn about the theory behind electronic circuits.
After 7th grade Science Olympiad, when I won second place medal in the state for the Shock Value event, I found out about the Make Magazine and the Arduino. Ever since I got the book Arduino Cookbook, I have created interesting electronic circuits, many of which have helped in my science projects.</p>

<div id="C2"><h2>3D Modeling &amp; Printing</h2><p>In the summer of 2014 I took an ID Tech Course on 3D modeling with the AutoDesk Maya Software. Later I also learnt to use the Blender Open Source 3D Software. During the IDtech camp I worked on a Tron Legacy car and a Star Wars lightsaber.</p>

<p>After the course in 3D modeling I decided to create my own custom 3D printed Lego parts. Due to the AutoDesk Maya student license terms, I used the Blender 3D software to model the custom parts. All the custom parts stick to the theme of Indian Mythology.</p>

<div id="C3"><h2>Web Design</h2><p>When I was 9 Years old I found Microsoft Publisher on the family computer and created my first useless and unpublished website. In the summer of 2015 I finally sat down and taught my self HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery. My final summer project, demonstrating my proficiency in these topics, was creating this website. Here is some of the code from my website.</p>
