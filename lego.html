                <p>For as long as I can remember I have been playing and building with legos. I proudly admit that I am a Teenage fan of Lego(TFOL)</p>
                <div id="slider"><div id="Caption"><h2>Lego Boeing 787</h2><p id="SliderText">I built the lego beoing 787 in 2009(at age 9). The whole build took around 1,900 bricks.</p></div></div>

              <div id="C2">
                <p>Three years ago I joined the Lego Youtuber community. As my skill level grew, I started to build bigger MOCS(My Own Creation) and realized that one of the biggest problems with lego is that the bricks are expensive. To combat this problem
                  I posted a video series called Pick a Brick Tips and Techniques. The lego Pick a Brick(PAB) wall is a large wall with buckets of lego bricks. Customers at the Lego Store can place as many bricks as possible into a Lego Cup of a certain size.
                  I realized that if I wanted to continue building large mocs, I had to figure out how to maximize the number of bricks I got at the PAB wall. I realized that deadspace(space unocupied by bricks) is minnimized when the bricks are stacked
                  one on top of another. The next issue I faced was that lego bricks are all rectangular prisms, while the cups are cylendrical. To combat this I have designed different "modules" made by stacking bricks together into a cyclender that perfectly
                  fits in this cup. At the Lego store, I found that I could fit more than three times the number of bricks than when I haphazardly threw the bricks into the cups. This resulted in spending only $30 for Lego bricks valued greater than $120. Stunned by my results, I started a YouTube channel where I posted a video teaching others how they could also save money on Lego bricks. Over the last few years my videos have gotten a total of 21,000 views and many comments about how my technique has been helping them. I am also proud to say that the video has been watched in
                  over 133 different countries. Here is the video.</p>

                <p>After taking a course in 3d modeling, I became curious about how this applied to my Lego MOCS. By combining Lego's Lego Digital Designer and the 3d software Blender, I was able to create interesting renders of my MOCS. Now I could plan
                  my MOCS and even visualize the end result before it was even built! After figuring out the compatability between Lego Digital Designer and Blender I posted a video on my youtube channel showing the process. The video was watched multiple times by those
                  in the Lego Youtbe community as it can assist everyone in speeding up the process of building a huge MOC.</p>

                      <p>A few years ago, while feeling a bit bored, I gave myself a challenge of trying to create a car creating two small lego sets. This left me with only 150 parts at my disposal. During the quick build, I though it would be cool to create a six wheel car. <i>Can a six wheel car even steer?</i></p>

                      <p>For my brother's birthday, which had a lego theme, I was given the task of incorporating the Goodie-bag lego set, a 3-in-1 lego constructions set, with an appealing background. I desided that a Lego Quarry would be an appropriate background and started model. My finished model used some interesting techniques like the SNOT (Studs Not on Top) technique.</p>

The project included a huge star wars base built inside of a mountain range on the star wars planet Utapau. The building contains functional LED lights. The photo was taken for my youtube channel as I post mounthly progress updates on the MOC. The MOC will most likley be finishd by August 2018 just in time for Brick Fair Virginia. </p>
