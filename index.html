	      		<p class="my-5">I am a rising Senior at Stanford with a background at the intersection of Electrical Engineering <i class="fas fa-microchip text-primary"></i> and Computer Science <i class="fas fa-code text-primary"></i>. I strive to use my skills to develop innovative solutions for solving the world's pressing problems.</p>
	      		<p class="my-5">Over the last three and a half years, I've been working at <a href="https://ad3.ai" class="link">Agile Data Driven Decisions (AD3)</a> as their Lead Software Architect and have developed the company's novel multi-echelon supply chain software. At AD3, we aim to optimize our clients' global supply chain through data driven decisions. The pipeline that I've built leverages state of the art optimization models augmented with large-scale non-traditional data sets which capture potential drivers of future demand. I've enjoyed working with multiple Fortune 500 clients through AD3.</p>
	      		<p class="my-5">Prior to that, in high school, I was honored to be invited to conduct research in the Boston/MIT area as part of the Center for Excellence in Education's <a href="https://www.cee.org/research-science-institute" class="link">Research Science Institute (RSI)</a> program. During RSI, my research at <a href="https://www.aurora.aero/" class="link">Aurora Flight Sciences</a> focused on developing a "Low Cost Sense and Avoid System" (LCSAS) for airplane <i class="fas fa-plane text-primary"></i> and drone collision avoidance. I'm especially excited by <a href="/files/RSI-LCSAA-RohanDeshpande.pdf" class="link">LCSAS</a>'s potential to significantly reduce the cost of aircraft collision-avoidance systems while improving aviation safety.</p>
	      		<p>Another project that I've worked on extensively is <a href="/files/RohanDeshpande-PowerOff-ResearchPaper.pdf" class="link">PowerOff</a> <i class="fas fa-bolt text-primary"></i>: a novel IoT based building/home/office traffic counter which can save significant amounts of electricity by toggling lights and other powered devices based on the occupancy of a room. The project received numerous awards (Google Science Fair, Intel ISEF, ISWEEP, etc.) and I filed for a provisional patent.</p>
	      		<p class="my-5">Aside from tinkering with circuits and <a href="https://github.com/RohanVDeshpande" class="link">coding</a>, I also enjoy creating <a href="https://www.behance.net/rohanvdeshpande" class="link">digital art</a>, playing the <a href="/hobby/2019/09/02/Bass.html" class="link">bass</a>, or building <a href="#" class="link">Lego art</a>.</p>
